A native **macOS (Apple Silicon)** build of the
[open.mp launcher](https://github.com/openmultiplayer/launcher). Upstream is
Windows-only; this fork adds the bits needed to build, sign, and run it on a
Mac.

## What you need

| Thing | Why |
|---|---|
| **Mac with Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3/M4) | Intel Macs are not supported. |
| **[CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover)** | Runs the Windows version of GTA: San Andreas on macOS. |
| **GTA: San Andreas v1.0** in a CrossOver bottle | SA-MP / open.mp only work with the **1.0** executable — Steam / Rockstar Launcher copies must be downgraded. |

The launcher cannot install the game or Windows for you — set the two above up
once, then the launcher handles everything else automatically.

## Install

1. Download `omp-launcher_*_aarch64.pkg` from
   [Releases](https://github.com/Mac-Andreas/omp-launcher-macOS/releases/latest).
2. Double-click the .pkg. Accept the license, click through, enter your
   password when prompted.
3. Open **omp-launcher** from Applications.

The installer's postinstall step clears `com.apple.quarantine` and re-applies
the ad-hoc signature on the installed app, so the bundle launches without the
macOS "damaged" warning — no Terminal steps required after install.

### If macOS blocks the .pkg on first run

This is a free, unofficial build with no paid Apple Developer account, so the
`.pkg` itself isn't notarised. On a fresh Mac, Gatekeeper may refuse to open
it on double-click and show a *"could not be verified... was blocked to
protect your Mac"* dialog. This is expected, not a sign of anything being
wrong with the file.

To allow it through (one-time, per download):

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
2. Scroll down to the **Security** section.
3. Next to the `omp-launcher_*_aarch64.pkg` line, click **Open Anyway**.
4. Confirm with your password / Touch ID.
5. Re-run the `.pkg` — it will now launch normally.

After install, the launcher itself opens without further Gatekeeper prompts;
the postinstall step takes care of that.

## Updates

The launcher checks **this repo's GitHub releases** for updates, not the
upstream Windows channel. Versions are tagged `1.6.3-arm.N` — a Windows
release like `1.6.4` will **not** prompt this build to update. Only when a new
`-arm` tag ships here does the "Update available" badge appear.

| Tag pattern | Source | Triggers update prompt? |
|---|---|---|
| `1.6.3-arm.N` | This fork | Yes |
| `1.6.4` | Upstream Windows | No |

## Building from source

Requirements:
[Rust nightly](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/channels.html),
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (not v20.6), Xcode command-line tools.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mac-Andreas/omp-launcher-macOS
cd omp-launcher-macOS
yarn
./scripts/build-macos.sh
```

`build-macos.sh` compiles, ad-hoc signs, and writes
`omp-launcher_<version>_aarch64.pkg` to the repo root.

Development: `yarn start`.
